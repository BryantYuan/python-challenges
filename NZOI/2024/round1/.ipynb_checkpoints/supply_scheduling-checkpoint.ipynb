    "<p>Two new zoos are set to open on the streets of New Zealand: Aardvark Asylum, and Basilisk Biosphere. When a zoo orders animal food, they have to pay for the shipping and the food. The shipping is a fixed cost, no matter how much animal food they order, and all shipments arrive on the day they're ordered. The two zoos realised that if they ordered food on the same day, they would only have to pay the shipping cost once between the two of them, saving them money!\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, both zoos require food shipments according to their own schedule. They both require shipments on exactly N days. Aardvark Asylum's schedule, A, is made up of N integers. Each integer in A represents an amount of days after opening, when the Asylum will require a shipment of food. Basilisk Biosphere's schedule, B, is also made up of N integers, each of which represents an amount of days after opening, when the Biosphere will require a shipment of food.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, the Asylum requires a shipment of food A[i] days after opening, for all values of i such that (0≤i≤N−1), and the Biosphere requires a shipment of food B[i] days after opening, for all values of i such that (0≤i≤N−1). Neither zoo can change their schedule, but they can change which day they open on. You have been brought on as a consultant, to help them figure out the fewest possible amount of days on which either zoo needs to order food, if the opening days of the two zoos are staggered optimally.</p>"
